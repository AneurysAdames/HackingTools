FAQ
===
- **Is Windows supported?**
- Nope, don't think it will ever be

- **Is OSX supported?**
- Initial compatibility has been introduced in 0.9.8, still needs some testing, find anything broken submit a PR or open an issue ticket!

- **I can't install package X because of an error!**
- Try installing the package via ```pip``` or your distro's package manager. This *isn't* a problem with MITMf.

- **How do I install package X?** or **I get an ImportError when launching MITMf!**
- Please read the installation guide in the [readme](README.md).

- **Dude, no documentation?**
- The docs are a work in progress at the moment, once the framework hits 1.0 I will push them to the wiki
